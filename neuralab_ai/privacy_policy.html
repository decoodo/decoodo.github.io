    <h1>Privacy Policy for NeuraLab AI</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>NeuraLab AI</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Images are processed securely. While "History" and "Scans" are saved <strong>locally</strong> on your device using secure encryption, images are transmitted to our cloud server temporarily for the sole purpose of AI analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>To Provide Services:</strong> To analyze your uploaded images and generate text results (e.g., eBay descriptions, dating ratings, OCR text).</li>
        <li><strong>To Maintain History:</strong> We store your past scans and generated results locally on your device so you can access them later.</li>
        <li><strong>To Serve Ads:</strong> We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements and Reward Ads to unlock Pro features.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use trusted third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>C. Cloud Processing</h3>
    <p>We transmit image data to our secure cloud endpoint for AI processing. This data is used strictly for generating the analysis you requested and is not stored permanently on our servers.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your scan history, including images and text prompts, is stored locally on your device using <code>FlutterSecureStorage</code> and <code>SharedPreferences</code>. You can clear this history at any time via the App settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> We use standard encryption protocols (HTTPS) when transmitting data to our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p><strong>NeuraLab AI is restricted to users aged 18 and older.</strong> We strictly enforce an age verification gate upon the first launch of the App. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we discover that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
